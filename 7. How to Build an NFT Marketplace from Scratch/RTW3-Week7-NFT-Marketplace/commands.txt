1. Use Alchemy's getNFTs and getNFTsForCollection endpoints to fetch NFTs for the marketplace and profile page
    
    Read https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/how-to-get-all-nfts-in-a-collection DONE
    Read https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/getnftsforcollection DONE 
    Comment previous code for NFTs for the marketplace DONE
    Create code to fetch NFTs for the marketplace DONE
    Comment previous code for NFTs for the profile page DONE
    Create code to fetch NFTs for the profile page DONE



2. Add functionality to let users list pre-existing NFTs to the marketplace

    -Back: Store in a array the addresses of the NFTs collections DONE
    -Front: In the marketplace, instead of recieving a single MarketplaceJSON.address. Generate a for loop for the several addresses stored to show them DONE
    -Front: Field to recieve a collection that the owner will register: FINISH ADDING PERSISTANCE TO THE INFORMATION OF THE NEW ADDRESS COLLECTIONS
    
3. Adding Royalties such that the original NFT creator gets 10% of the proceeds every time that NFT gets sold
